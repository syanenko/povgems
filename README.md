# Povray gems rendering extension
 [SpectralRenderer](https://www.lilysoft.org/CGI/SR/Spectral%20Render.htm), to [POV-Ray](https://www.povray.org/), written by Ive of LILYsoft has few excelent examples of gems rendering and set of mineral materials.
 This reposotory contains few additions, improving gems rendering techniques and gems geomety in _DXF_ and SDL _mesh_ format.

Great source of gems geometry can be found here:
http://www.facetdiagrams.org/database/

To convert _ASC_ format from this database to DXF [GemCad](https://www.gemcad.com) (which is free now) or more modern tool -
[GemcutStudio](https://gemcutstudio.com) can be used. Last also has _OBJ_ export function.

Then, under Windows for _DXF_ / _OBJ_ to SDL convertion you can use [PoseRay](https://sites.google.com/site/poseray/home-1) or
if you prefere Unix, use [dxf2pov](https://github.com/syanenko/dxf2pov), which also can be compiled under Windows.


For OBJ

The next step 

and is able to export DXF, so I am working on simple dxf2pov converter
to get professional gems geometry, will notify when finish.

If you are interesting in 'geming', here are great sources of
ready-to-use designs:
